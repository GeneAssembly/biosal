/**
 * How to use:
 *
 * 1. The script must be set with BSAL_MANAGER_SET_SCRIPT
 * (reply is BSAL_MANAGER_SET_SCRIPT_REPLY).
 *
 * 2. The number of actors per spawner is set with
 * BSAL_MANAGER_SET_ACTORS_PER_SPAWNER (reply is
 * BSAL_MANAGER_SET_ACTORS_PER_SPAWNER_REPLY). The default is to
 * spawn as many actors as there are workers on a spawner's
 * node.
 *
 * 3. The number of actors per worker can also be changed
 * with BSAL_MANAGER_SET_ACTORS_PER_WORKER (reply is
 * BSAL_MANAGER_SET_ACTORS_PER_WORKER_REPLY). The default is 1.
 *
 * 4. Finally, BSAL_ACTOR_START is sent to the manager (buffer contains
 * a vector of spawners). The manager
 * will reply with BSAL_ACTOR_START_REPLY and the buffer will
 * contain a vector of spawned actors (spawned using the provided spawners).
