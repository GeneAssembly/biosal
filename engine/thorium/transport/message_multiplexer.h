 * Genomic graph traversal is characterized by:
 *
 * - a high ratio of consumer actors (visitors, walkers, and so on) to producer actors (graph stores)
 *   - small messages (example: ACTION_ASSEMBLY_GET_VERTEX)
 *
 *   Today, I implemented a multiplexer in thorium (< 500 lines).
 *
 *   With the current setting, it is giving a 25% decrease in running time on my small example.
 *   (parameters are 1 KiB for buffers and 512 us for maximum length of accumulation window
 *
 *
 *   It is very modular too.
 *
 *   I added 5 calls (around 10 lines)
 *   in thorium_node (in node.c, init, destroy, and 3 hooks: multiplex, demultiplex, test)
