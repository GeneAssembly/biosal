Factors:

# queue implementation (no moves)

linked list of rings, maximize reutilization with a recycle bin


# good work scheduling algorithm

attempt count is currently 4


# lockless rings for workers

One for works, one for messages


# Concurrency

This is a good read: http://disruptor.googlecode.com/files/Disruptor-1.0.pdf

2 important things:

- Mutual exclusion when writing a shared variable
- Visibility of changes in other threads

If any variable has only one writer, then mutual exclusion is enforced
without doing anything.

# Profiling

Tools used: perf, valgrind, gprof, gdb


# Stateless actors

Stateless actors are more predictable in their performance and should be selected
whenever possible.
