Here are some guidelines to creating actor applications with
Thorium which provides no premptive multitasking (it uses
a run-to-completion approach).

1. Over-decomposition should be favored. An actor should do one thing
and do it well (this is similar to the UNIX philosophy). Having a lot of
actors per CPU core allows overlapping of communication and computation.

2. Messages should be small, but not too small to avoid a low
computation-to-communication ratio. Buffer sizes can be adjusted
so that actor receive computations last longer than communications.
Big messages are not generally a good idea because typically an
actor that receives a big message will hog the CPU core for a while

3. The request-reply message pattern is needed frequently to avoid
communication imbalance. Such an imbalance is also called
producer-consumer imbalance.

4. An actor can avoid running for too long by sending ACTION_YIELD to
itself. Such an actor is then responsible to figure out where the
continuation should take place.

5. Another trick to keep the "pipeline" busy is to have more than 1 in-flight
message for any destination (at the expense of memory usage).
