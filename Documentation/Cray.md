The code works with the Cray compiler (tested: Cray C : Version 8.1.4)
and with the GNU compiler (gcc version 4.8.1 20130531 (Cray Inc.) (GCC)).

The code is roughtly 2 times faster when compiled with GCC. The hypothesis is that
GCC (the 4.8 series) generates superior x86-64 assembly code that contains a significantly lower
number of branches. See http://lists.cels.anl.gov/pipermail/biosal/2014-October/000011.html
