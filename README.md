# Design

| Concept | Description | Structure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Message | Information with a source and a destination | struct bsal_message |
| Actor | Something that receives messages | struct bsal_actor |
| Work | 2-tuple with an Actor and a Message | struct bsal_work |
| Node | A runtime system that can be connected to other Node instances (see [Erlang's definition http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/distributed.html]) | struct bsal_node |
| Worker | An object that performs work for a living | bsal_worker_thread |
| Queue | Each Worker has a Work Queue and a Message Queue | bsal_fifo |


Work to be done has to be formulated in term of actors (bsal_actor).
A bsal_actor has a name, do something when it receives a bsal_message.
A bsal_message is however first received by a bsal_node. The bsal_node
prepares a bsal_work and gives it to a bsal_worker_pool. The bsal_worker_pool
assigns the bsal_work to a bsal_worker_thread. Finally,  the bsal_worker_thread calls
receive using the bsal_actor and bsal_message presented inside the bsal_work.

# Runtime

The number of bsal_node nodes is set by mpiexec -n @number_of_bsal_nodes
The number of bsal_worker_thread objects on each bsal_node is set with
-workers-by-node

The following command starts 256 bsal_node node nodes (there is 1 MPI rank per
bsal_node) and 64 bsal_worker_thread workers per bsal_node for a total of
256 * 64 = 16384 distributed workers.

Because the whole thing is event - driven by inbound and outbound messages,
a single bsal_node can run much more bsal_actor actors than the number of
bsal_worker_thread workers.

# Application programming interface

Functions that can be called within an actor context
| Function | Description |
| bsal_actor_spawn | Spawn a new actor and return its name |
| bsal_actor_send | Send a message |
| bsal_actor_die | Die |
