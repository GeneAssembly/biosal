# Design



Key concepts

| Concept | Description | Structure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Message | Information with a source and a destination | struct bsal_message |
| Actor | Something that receives messages | struct bsal_actor |
| Work | 2-tuple with an actor and a message | struct bsal_work |
| Node | A runtime system that can be connected to other nodes (see [Erlang's definition](http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/distributed.html)) | struct bsal_node |
| Worker | An object that performs work for a living | bsal_worker_thread |
| Queue | Each worker has a work queue and a message queue | struct bsal_fifo |
| Worker Pool | A set of available workers inside a node | struct bsal_worker_pool |


## Workflow

The code has to be formulated in term of actors.
An actor has a name, and does something when it receives a message.
A message is however first received by a node. The node
prepares a work and gives it to a worker_pool. The worker pool
assigns the work to a worker. Finally, worker eventually calls
the corresponding receive function using the actor and message presented inside
the work.

When an actor receives a message, it can:

- send a finite number of messages to other actors (bsal_actor_send);
- create a finite number of new actors (bnsal_actor_spawn);
- designate the behavior to be used for the next message it receives (bsal_actor_actor, bsal_actor_die).


# Runtime

The number of nodes is set by mpiexec -n @number_of_bsal_nodes
The number of workers on each node is set with
-workers-by-node

The following command starts 256 nodes (there is 1 MPI rank per
node) and 64 workers per node for a total of
256 * 64 = 16384 distributed workers.

Because the whole thing is event-driven by inbound and outbound messages,
a single node can run much more actors than the number of
workers it has.

# Application programming interface

Functions that can be called within an actor context

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| bsal_node_spawn | Spawn an actor from the outside,  this is usually used to spawn the first actor of a node |
| bsal_actor_spawn | Spawn a new actor and return its name |
| bsal_actor_send | Send a message |
| bsal_actor_die | Die |
| bsal_actor_nodes | Get number of nodes |
| bsal_actor_pin | Pin an actor to an worker for memory affinity purposes |
| bsal_actor_unpin | Unpin an actor |
