# Actor model

The actor model has actors and messages, mostly.

When an actor receives a message, it can ([Agha 1986](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=7929), p. 12, 2.1.3):

- send a finite number of messages to other actors (**bsal_actor_send**);
- create a finite number of new actors (**bsal_actor_spawn**, **BSAL_ACTOR_SPAWN**);
- designate the behavior to be used for the next message it receives (**bsal_actor_state**, **BSAL_ACTOR_STOP**).

Other names for the actor model: actors, virtual processors, activation frames, streams
([Hewitt, Bishop, Steiger 1973](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1624804)).

Also, in the actor model, the arrival order of messages is both arbitrary and unknown
([Agha 1986](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=7929), p. 22, 2.4).

One of the most important requirements of actors is that of acquaintances. An actor can only send
message to one of its acquaintances.
Acquaintance vectors were introduced in ([Hewitt and Baker 1977](http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/41962), p. 7,
                section III.3).
Any actor using an acquaintance vector is migratable by an actor machine.
An actor machine can distribute and balance actors according to some arbitrary rules wwhen
all the actors in an actor system use acquaintance vectors.

# Design

Key concepts

| Concept | Description | Structure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Message | Information with a source and a destination | struct bsal_message |
| Actor | Something that receives messages and behaves according to a script | struct bsal_actor |
| Script | Describes the behavior of an actor ([Hewitt, Bishop, Steiger 1973](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.77.7898))| struct bsal_script |
| Work | 2-tuple with an actor and a message | struct bsal_work |
| Node | A runtime system that can be connected to other nodes (see [Erlang's definition](http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/distributed.html)) | struct bsal_node |
| Worker | An object that performs work for a living | bsal_worker |
| Queue | Each worker has a work queue and a message queue | struct bsal_fifo |
| Worker Pool | A set of available workers inside a node | struct bsal_worker_pool |

## Implementation of the runtime system

The code has to be formulated in term of actors.
An actor has a name, and does something when it receives a message.
A message is however first received by a node. The node
prepares a work and gives it to a worker_pool. The worker pool
assigns the work to a worker. Finally, worker eventually calls
the corresponding receive function using the actor and message presented inside
the work.

When an actor sends a message, the destination is either an actor on the
same node or an actor on another node. The runtime sends messages for actors
on other nodes with MPI. Otherwise, a work is prepared and assigned to
a worker directly on the same node.

## Runtime

The number of nodes is set by mpiexec -n @number_of_bsal_nodes ./a.out.
The number of threads on each node is set with -threads-per-node.

The following command starts 256 nodes (there is 1 MPI rank per
node) and 64 threads per node for a total of
256 * 64 = 16384 threads.

```bash
mpiexec -n 256 ./a.out -threads-per-node 64
```

Because the whole thing is event-driven by inbound and outbound messages,
a single node can run much more actors than the number of
threads it has.

The runtime also supports asymmetric numbers of threads:

```bash
# launch 32 nodes with 32 threads, 244 threads, 32 threads, 244 threads, and so on
mpiexec -n 32 ./a.out -threads-per-node 32,244
```
