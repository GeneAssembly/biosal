# Actor model

The actor model has actors and messages, mostly.

When an actor receives a message, it can ([Agha 1986](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=7929), p. 12, 2.1.3):

- send a finite number of messages to other actors (bsal_actor_send);
- create a finite number of new actors (bnsal_actor_spawn);
- designate the behavior to be used for the next message it receives (bsal_actor_actor, bsal_actor_die).

Other names for the actor model: actors, virtual processors, activation frames, streams
([Hewitt, Bishop, Steiger 1973](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1624804)).

Also, in the actor model, the arrival order of messages is both arbitrary and unknown
([Agha 1986](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=7929), p. 22, 2.4).

# Design

Key concepts

| Concept | Description | Structure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Message | Information with a source and a destination | struct bsal_message |
| Actor | Something that receives messages | struct bsal_actor |
| Work | 2-tuple with an actor and a message | struct bsal_work |
| Node | A runtime system that can be connected to other nodes (see [Erlang's definition](http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/distributed.html)) | struct bsal_node |
| Worker | An object that performs work for a living | bsal_worker_thread |
| Queue | Each worker has a work queue and a message queue | struct bsal_fifo |
| Worker Pool | A set of available workers inside a node | struct bsal_worker_pool |

## Workflow

The code has to be formulated in term of actors.
An actor has a name, and does something when it receives a message.
A message is however first received by a node. The node
prepares a work and gives it to a worker_pool. The worker pool
assigns the work to a worker. Finally, worker eventually calls
the corresponding receive function using the actor and message presented inside
the work.

## Runtime

The number of nodes is set by mpiexec -n @number_of_bsal_nodes
The number of workers on each node is set with
-workers-by-node

The following command starts 256 nodes (there is 1 MPI rank per
node) and 64 workers per node for a total of
256 * 64 = 16384 distributed workers.

Because the whole thing is event-driven by inbound and outbound messages,
a single node can run much more actors than the number of
workers it has.
